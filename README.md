Study project to learn a popular stack, MERN stack, using free code camp. Will be periodically updating project along with adding my own twist to things as I see fit and learn more

Used MongoDB atlas, used sample data sets/collections to test out the program created. 

Created Indexes in MongoDB for specific searches

Used tools like Insomnia.rest to test our api and indexes instead of using the browser, actions such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Had to read documentation to update the dependencies that were depreciated, such as for MongoClient how poolSize is now maxPoolSize, wtimeout is now wtimeoutMS, how useNewUrlParse is now useNewUrlParser

Bootstrap framework was used to design application

Axios library was used for the get, post, put, and delete requests

React used with react hooks
